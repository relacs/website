<h3>Why the name "RELACS"?</h3>
<p>
  Until 2007 the program was named <strong>OEL</strong>
  (Online Electrophysiology Laboratory).
  This was cool for the Germans, since "OEL" (="&Ouml;l") means "oil".
  However, "OEL" is just "O-E-L" for the rest of the world,
  which is neither cool nor funny.
  In addition, "oil" is a fossil fuel that you should avoid anyways...
</p>
<p>
  So, a new name was needed!
</p>
<p>
  "T. racs" is certainly as cool as a dinosaur can be, but
  you don't want to have such a creature in your lab.
  Then, of course, we were making fun with something like
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything">"forty-two"</a>
  and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything">"don't panic"</a>,
  and there you are - relax.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="relacs">relacs</span> is an abbreviation for
  "<b>R</b>elaxed <b>El</b>ectrophysiological data <b>A</b>cquisition, <b>C</b>ontrol, and <b>S</b>timulation",
  which describes the features of the program pretty well.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="relacs">relacs</span> (pronounced "relax!")
  refers to the usage of the program
  during an experiment. With the online analysis features
  you immediately see what's going on and you don't need
  to interfere with any manual settings - you can simply relax and enjoy
  the data coming in.
</p>


<h3>Why is RELACS written in C++?</h3>
<p>
  Each cycle in an closed-loop experiment
  requires a heavy load of computations do be done 
  in real time -
  spike detection, data analysis, stimulus generation, and so on.
  So, slow scripting languages (like matlab or python) 
  definitely don't do the job.
  We need a compiled language that is quick, structured, and 
  works well with penguins - C++.
</p>


<h3>Can I just present a stimulus without any fancy closed-loop stuff?</h3>
<p>
  Of course you can! <span class="relacs">relacs</span> offers a framework
  to support closed-loop approaches, but you don't have to make use
  of this. Simply presenting a predefined stimulus
  (that, for example, might be stored in a file) at a fixed 
  output intensity is possible.
  In fact, there is already an implemented experimental protocol
  that just does this 
  (e.g. the SingleStimulus plugin from the 
  <a href="../plugins/auditory/Auditory-SingleStimulus.html">auditory</a> and the
  <a href="../plugins/patchclamp/Patch-clamp-SingleStimulus.html">patch-clamp</a>
  plugin sets).
