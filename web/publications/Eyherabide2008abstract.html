    <h2>Abstract</h2>

      Various classes of neurons alternate between high-frequency
      discharges and silent intervals. This phenomenon is called burst
      firing. To analyze burst activity in an insect system,
      grasshopper auditory receptor neurons were recorded in vivo for
      several distinct stimulus types. The experimental data show that
      both burst probability and burst characteristics are strongly
      influenced by temporal modulations of the acoustic stimulus. The
      tendency to burst, hence, is not only determined by
      cell-intrinsic processes, but also by their interaction with the
      stimulus time course. We study this interaction quantitatively
      and observe that bursts containing a certain number of spikes
      occur shortly after stimulus deflections of specific intensity
      and duration. Our findings suggest a sparse neural code where
      information about the stimulus is represented by the number of
      spikes per burst, irrespective of the detailed
      interspike-interval structure within a burst. This compact
      representation cannot be interpreted as a firing-rate code. An
      information-theoretical analysis reveals that the number of
      spikes per burst reliably conveys information about the
      amplitude and duration of sound transients, whereas their time
      of occurrence is reflected by the burst onset time. The
      investigated neurons encode almost half of the total transmitted
      information in burst activity.
