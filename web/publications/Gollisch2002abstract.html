    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    We investigate the transduction of sound stimuli into neural
    responses and focus on locust auditory receptor cells. As in other
    mechanosensory model systems, these neurons integrate acoustic
    inputs over a fairly broad frequency range. To test three
    alternative hypotheses about the nature of this spectral
    integration (amplitude, energy, pressure), we perform
    intracellular recordings while stimulating with superpositions of
    pure tones. On the basis of online data analysis and automatic
    feedback to the stimulus generator, we systematically explore
    regions in stimulus space that lead to the same level of neural
    activity. Focusing on such iso-firing-rate regions allows for a
    rigorous quantitative comparison of the electrophysiological data
    with predictions from the three hypotheses that is independent of
    nonlinearities induced by the spike dynamics. We find that the
    dependence of the firing rates of the receptors on the composition
    of the frequency spectrum can be well described by an
    energy-integrator model. This result holds at stimulus onset as
    well as for the steady-state response, including the case in which
    adaptation effects depend on the stimulus spectrum. Predictions of
    the model for the responses to bandpass-filtered noise stimuli are
    verified accurately. Together, our data suggest that the
    sound-intensity coding of the receptors can be understood as a
    three-step process, composed of a linear filter, a summation of
    the energy contributions in the frequency domain, and a
    firing-rate encoding of the resulting effective sound
    intensity. These findings set quantitative constraints for future
    biophysical models.
