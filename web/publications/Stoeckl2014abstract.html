    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>
      Extracting complementary features in parallel pathways is a
      widely used strategy for a robust representation of sensory
      signals. Weakly electric fish offer the rare opportunity to
      study complementary encoding of social signals in all of its
      electrosensory pathways.  Electrosensory information is conveyed
      in three parallel pathways: two receptor types of the tuberous
      (active) system and one receptor type of the ampullary (passive)
      system. Modulations of the fish's own electric field are
      sensed by these receptors and used in navigation, prey-detection
      and communication.

      We studied the neuronal representation of electric communication
      signals (called chirps) in the ampullary and the two tuberous
      pathways of <i>Eigenmannia virescens</i>. We first characterized
      different kinds of chirps observed in behavioral
      experiments. Since Eigenmannia chirps simultaneously drive all
      three types of receptors, we studied their responses in <i>in
      vivo</i> electrophysiological recordings. Our results
      demonstrate that different electroreceptor types encode
      different aspects of the stimuli and each appears best suited to
      convey information about a certain chirp type. A decoding
      analysis of single neurons and small populations shows that
      this specialization leads to a complementary representation of
      information in the tuberous and ampullary receptors. This
      suggests that a potential readout mechanism should combine
      information provided by the parallel processing streams to
      improve chirp detectability.
