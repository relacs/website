    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>
      Metadata providing information about the stimulus, data
      acquisition, and experimental conditions are indispensable for
      the analysis and management of experimental data within a
      lab. However, only rarely are metadata available in a
      structured, comprehensive, and machine-readable form. This poses
      a severe problem for finding and retrieving data, both in the
      laboratory and on the various emerging public data bases. Here,
      we propose a simple format, the "open metaData Markup Language"
      (odML), for collecting and exchanging metadata in an automated,
      computer-based fashion. In odML arbitrary metadata information
      is stored as extended keyâ€“value pairs in a hierarchical
      structure. Central to odML is a clear separation of format and
      content, i.e., neither keys nor values are defined by the
      format. This makes odML flexible enough for storing all
      available metadata instantly without the necessity to submit new
      keys to an ontology or controlled terminology. Common standard
      keys can be defined in odML-terminologies for guaranteeing
      interoperability. We started to define such terminologies for
      neurophysiological data, but aim at a community driven extension
      and refinement of the proposed definitions. By customized
      terminologies that map to these standard terminologies, metadata
      can be named and organized as required or preferred without
      softening the standard. Together with the respective libraries
      provided for common programming languages, the odML format can
      be integrated into the laboratory workflow, facilitating
      automated collection of metadata information where it becomes
      available. The flexibility of odML also encourages a community
      driven collection and definition of terms used for annotating
      data in the neurosciences.
