    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Relacs ("Relaxed ELectrophysiological data Acquisition, Control,
      and Stimulation", <a href="http://www.relacs.net">www. relacs.net</a>)
      is a fully customizable software platform for data acquisition,
      online analysis, and stimulus generation specifically designed
      for electrophysiological recordings. Filters and spike detectors
      can be applied instantly on the recorded potentials. Freely
      programmable, hardware independent C++ plugins can access the
      preprocessed data for further online analysis and
      visualization. Therefore the experimental protocols can
      automatically adapt a stimulus (e.g. offset, variance, etc.) in
      a closed loop fashion and thus completely control the running
      experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
      For offline data-analysis, data management, and data sharing the
      annotation of the raw data with metadata that specify the
      stimuli, the recorded neuron, the animal, as well as context of
      the experiment is necessary. Traditionally, such data have been
      written into lab books. File formats for metadata are often
      tailored to a specific database schema and thus assume a very
      detailed and specific structure and context. Within a lab this
      specificity is usually not a problem as long as the same
      database schema is used. However, these file formats for
      metadata are very difficult to handle, when it comes to sharing
      data within a larger community, in particular via the upcoming
      initiatives of public databases. In addition, in most cases,
      such metadata files do not even exist.
    </p>

    <p>
      We here want to stress that the recording software used for
      acquiring the raw data knows already many of the metadata. In
      particular, these are properties of the generated stimuli and
      settings of the controlled hardware. Therefore metadata in
      principle can and should be immediately acquired during the
      acquisition of the raw data in order to minimize manual efforts
      in providing this important data. As a closed-loop software
      RELACS has all this information available and saves it to disk.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also developed a file format for hierarchically organized
      key-value pairs that is independent of any specific
      database-schema and thus can be used as a general file format
      for exchanging metadata.  Through customized terminologies the
      metadata can be structured and standardized for ensuring
      interoperability while at the same time not restricting the
      content, thus ensuring immediate flexibility.  This way,
      metadata can be submitted to a local as well as public
      data-bases, like for example to the German neuroinformatics node
      at <a href="http://www.g-node.org">www.g-node.org</a>, without
      any manual interference (see talk by Jan Grewe at symposium 10).
    </p>

    <p>
      In our live demonstration we exemplify this approach by
      acquiring simulated data with RELACS and diretly importing the
      metadata to LabLog - the laboratory logbook, a datamanagement
      program for any neuroscientific lab
      (<a href="http://lablog.sourceforge.net/">http://lablog.sourceforge.net/</a>,
      see poster by Adrian Stoewer and Jan Grewe).
