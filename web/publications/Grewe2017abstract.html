    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Synchronous activity in populations of neurons potentially
      encodes special stimulus features. Selective readout of either
      synchronous or asynchronous activity allows formation of two
      streams of information processing. Theoretical work predicts
      that such a synchrony code is a fundamental feature of
      populations of spiking neurons if they operate in specific noise
      and stimulus regimes. Here we experimentally test the
      theoretical predictions by quantifying and comparing neuronal
      response properties in tuberous and ampullary electroreceptor
      afferents of the weakly electric fish <i>Apteronotus
      leptorhynchus</i>. These related systems show similar levels of
      synchronous activity, but only in the more irregularly firing
      tuberous afferents a synchrony code is established, whereas in
      the more regularly firing ampullary afferents it is not. The
      mere existence of synchronous activity is thus not sufficient
      for a synchrony code. Single-cell features such as the
      irregularity of spiking and the frequency dependence of the
      neuronâ€™s transfer function determine whether synchronous spikes
      possess a distinct meaning for the encoding of time-dependent
      signals.
