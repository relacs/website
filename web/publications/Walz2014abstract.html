    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>
      Although communication signals often vary continuously on the
      underlying signal parameter, they are perceived as distinct
      categories. We here report the opposite case where an
      electrocommunication signal is encoded in four distinct regimes,
      although the behaviour described to date does not show distinct
      categories. In particular, we studied the encoding of chirps by
      P-unit afferents in the weakly electric fish <i>Apteronotus
      leptorhynchus</i>. These fish generate an electric organ discharge
      that oscillates at a certain individual-specific frequency. The
      interaction of two fish in communication contexts leads to the
      emergence of a beating amplitude modulation (AM) at the
      frequency difference between the two individual signals. This
      frequency difference represents the social context of the
      encounter. Chirps are transient increases of the fish's
      frequency leading to transient changes in the frequency of the
      AM. We stimulated the cells with the same chirp on different,
      naturally occurring backgrounds beats. The P-units responded
      either by synchronization or desynchronization depending on the
      background. Although the duration of a chirp is often shorter
      than a full cycle of the AM it elicits, the distinct responses
      of the P-units to the chirp can be predicted solely from the
      frequency of the AM based on the static frequency tuning of the
      cells.
