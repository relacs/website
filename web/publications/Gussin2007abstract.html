    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    We estimated the frequency-intensity (f-I) curves of P-unit
    electrore- ceptors using 4-Hz random amplitude modulations (RAMs)
    and using the covariance method (50-Hz RAMs). Both methods showed
    that P-units are linear encoders of stimulus amplitude with
    additive noise; the gain of the f-I curve was, on average, 0.32
    and 2.38 spikes s<sup>-1</sup> &micro;V<sup>-1</sup> for the low- and high-frequency cutoffs,
    respectively. There were two sources of apparent noise in the
    encoding process: the first was the variability of baseline P-unit
    discharge and the second was the variation of receptor discharge
    due to variability of the stimulus slope independent of its
    intensity. The covariance method showed that a linear combination
    of eigenvectors representing the time-weighted stimulus intensity
    (E1) and its derivative (E2) could account for, on average, 92% of
    the total response variability; E1 by itself accounted for 76% of
    the variability. The low gain of the low-frequency f-I curve
    implies that detection of small (1 &micro;V) signals would require
    integration over many receptors (1,200) and time (200 ms); even
    then, signals that elicit behavioral responses could not be
    detected using rate coding with the estimated gain and noise
    levels.  Weak signals at the limit of behavioral thresholds could
    be detected if the animal were able to extract E1 from the
    population of responding P units; we propose a tentative mechanism
    for this operation although there is no evidence as to whether it
    is actually implemented in the nervous system of these fish.
