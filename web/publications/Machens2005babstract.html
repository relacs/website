    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    According to Barlow's seminal 'efficient coding hypothesis' the
    coding strategy of sensory neurons should be matched to the
    statistics of stimuli that occur in an animal's natural
    habitat. Using an automatic search technique, we here test this
    hypothesis and identify stimulus ensembles that sensory neurons
    are optimized for. Focusing on grasshopper auditory receptor
    neurons, we find that their optimal stimulus ensembles differ from
    the natural environment, but largely overlap with a behaviorally
    important sub-ensemble of the natural sounds. This indicates that
    the receptors are optimized for peak rather than average
    performance. More generally, our results suggest that the coding
    strategies of sensory neurons are heavily influenced by
    differences in behavioral relevance among natural stimuli.
