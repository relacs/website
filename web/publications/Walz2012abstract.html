    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>
      Weakly-electric fish are a well-established model system for
      neuroethological studies on communication and aggression. Sensory
      encoding of their electric communication signals, as well as
      behavioural responses to these signals, have been investigated in
      great detail under laboratory conditions. In the wave-type brown ghost
      knifefish, Apteronotus leptorhynchus, transient increases in the
      frequency of the generated electric field, called chirps, are
      particularly well-studied, since they can be readily evoked by
      stimulating a fish with artificial signals mimicking
      conspecifics. When two fish interact, both their quasi-sinusoidal
      electric fields (called electric organ discharge, EOD) superimpose,
      resulting in a beat, an amplitude modulation at the frequency
      difference between the two EODs.  Although chirps themselves are
      highly stereotyped signals, the shape of the amplitude modulation
      resulting from a chirp superimposed on a beat background depends on a
      number of parameters, such as the beat frequency, modulation depth,
      and beat phase at which the chirp is emitted. Here we review the
      influence of these beat parameters on chirp encoding in the three
      primary stages of the electrosensory pathway: electroreceptor
      afferents, the hindbrain electrosensory lateral line lobe, and
      midbrain torus semicircularis. We then examine the role of these
      parameters, which represent specific features of various social
      contexts, for the behavioural responses of A. leptorhynchus. Some
      aspects of the behaviour may be explained by the coding properties of
      early sensory neurons to chirp stimuli.  However, the complexity and
      diversity of behavioural responses to chirps in the context of
      different background parameters cannot be explained solely on the
      basis of the sensory responses and thus suggest that critical roles
      are played by higher processing stages.
