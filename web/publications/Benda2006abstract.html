    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    Synchronous spiking of neural populations is hypothesized to play
    important computational roles in forming neural assemblies and
    solving the binding problem.  Although the opposite phenomenon of
    desynchronization is well known from EEG studies, it is largely
    neglected on the neuronal level.  We here provide an example of
    <i>in vivo</i> recordings from weakly-electric fish
    demonstrating that, depending on the social context, different
    types of natural communication signals elicit transient
    desynchronization as well as synchronization of the
    electroreceptor population without changing the mean firing rate.
    We conclude that, in general, both positive and negative changes
    in the degree of synchrony can be the relevant signals for neural
    information processing.
