    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>
      Relacs ("Relaxed ELectrophysiological data Acquisition, Control,
      and Stimulation") is a fully customizable software platform for
      data acquisition, online analysis, and stimulus generation
      specifically designed for electrophysiological
      recordings. Filters and spike detectors can be applied instantly
      on the recorded potentials. Freely programmable, hardware
      independent C++ plugins can access the preprocessed data for
      further online analysis and visualization. Therefore the
      experimental protocols can automatically adapt a stimulus
      (e.g. offset, variance, etc.) in a closed loop fashion and thus
      completely control the running experiment.  For programming the
      experimental protocols, the Relacs package also provides a data
      analysis library containing algorithms for basic statistics
      (moments, quartiles, histogram), power spectra, coherence,
      transfer function, linear fits, non-linear fits (Simplex,
      Levenberg-Marquardt), firing rates (mean, PSTH binned/kernel,
      1/ISI), CV, Fano factor, ISI correlations, vector strength,
      reliability, jitter, mutual information (lower and upper bound),
      etc.  A simulation mode not only allows to test and improve the
      experimental protocols, but also to check the performance of
      models with the very same procedures that were used in the real
      electrophysiological experiments.

    <p>
      The dynamic clamp is a closed-loop experiment on a per sample
      basis where each sampled value of the cell's membrane potential
      is used to compute a current that is injected back into the
      cell. Relacs supports software dynamic clamp, i.e. no additional
      hardware is needed, that is implemented as an RTAI real time
      Linux kernel module. For using the full potential of
      discontinuous current-clamp amplifiers for the dynamic clamp we
      are synchronizing the switching cycle of an npi SEC amplifier
      with the software loop (in collaboration with H. R. Polder, npi
      electronic GmbH, Tamm, Germany).
    </p>

    <p>
      Very important for enhancing the reusability of acquired data is
      their annotation with meta-data that specify the context of the
      experiment. Upon completion of a recording, Relacs immediately
      forces the experimenter to provide this important information
      through a freely configurable dialog. In addition, for each
      recording all configuration files, log files, and version
      numbers and settings of the experimental protocols are saved as
      well. All the meta-data can be automatically stored in LabLog
      (see Poster by Jan Grewe) for enhancing reusability of the
      recorded data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Relacs is free and open software published under the GPL to
      foster development and exchange of innovative experimental
      protocols and analysis techniques. In particular, Relacs will be
      a test bed for the data analysis toolboxes and data format
      interfaces from the German Neuroinformatics Node (<a
      href="www.g-node.org">www.g-node.org</a>).  For more information
