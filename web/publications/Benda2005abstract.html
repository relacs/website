    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    Spike-frequency adaptation is a prominent feature of many neurons.
    However, little is known about its computational role in processing
    behaviorally relevant natural stimuli beyond filtering out slow
    changes in stimulus intensity.
    Here we present a more complex example where we demonstrate how
    spike-frequency adaptation plays a key role in separating transient
    signals from slower oscillatory signals.
    We recorded <i>in vivo</i> from very rapidly adapting
    electroreceptor afferents of the weakly electric fish 
    <i>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</i>.
    The firing-frequency response of electroreceptors
    to fast communication stimuli ("small chirps") is
    strongly enhanced compared to the response to slower oscillations ("beats")
    arising from interactions of same-sex conspecifics.
    We are able to accurately predict the 
    electroreceptor afferent response to chirps and beats,
    using a recently proposed general model for spike-frequency adaptation.
    The model's parameters are determined for each neuron individually
    from the responses to step stimuli.
    We conclude that
    the dynamics of the rapid spike-frequency adaptation is sufficient
    to explain the data.
    Analysis of additional data from step-responses demonstrates that spike
    frequency adaptation acts subtractively rather than divisively
    as expected from depressing synapses.
    Therefore, the adaptation dynamics is linear
    and creates a high-pass filter with a
    cutoff frequency of 23&nbsp;Hz that separates
    fast signals from slower changes in input.
    A similar critical frequency is seen in
    behavioral data on the probability
    of a fish emitting chirps as a function of beat frequency.
    These results demonstrate how spike-frequency adaptation in general 
    can facilitate extraction of signals of different time scales,
    specifically high-frequency signals embedded in slower oscillations.
