    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    Reliable accounts of the variability observed in neural spike
    trains are a prerequisite for the proper interpretation of neural
    dynamics and coding principles. Models that accurately describe
    neural variability over a wide range of stimulation and response
    patterns are therefore highly desirable, especially if they can
    explain this variability in terms of basic neural observables and
    parameters such as firing rate and refractory period. In this
    work, we analyze the response variability recorded in vivo from
    locust auditory receptor neurons under acoustic stimulation. In
    agreement with results from other systems, our data suggest that
    neural refractoriness has a strong influence on spike-train
    variability. We therefore explore a stochastic model of spike
    generation that includes refractoriness through a recovery
    function. Because our experimental data are consistent with a
    renewal process, the recovery function can be derived from a
    single interspike-interval histogram obtained under constant
    stimulation. The resulting description yields quantitatively
    accurate predictions of the response variability over the whole
    range of firing rates for constant-intensity as well as
    amplitude-modulated sound stimuli. Model parameters obtained from
    constant stimulation can be used to predict the variability in
    response to dynamic stimuli. These results demonstrate that key
    ingredients of the stochastic response dynamics of a sensory
    neuron are faithfully captured by a simple stochastic model
    framework.
