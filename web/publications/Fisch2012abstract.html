    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>
      Spike-timing variability has a large effect on neural
      information processing. However, for many systems little is known
      about the noise sources causing the spike-response variability. Here
      we investigate potential sources of spike-response variability in
      auditory receptor neurons of locusts, a classic insect model
      system. At low spike frequencies, our data show negative
      interspike-interval correlations and interspike-interval distributions
      that match the inverse Gaussian distribution. These findings can be
      explained by a white-noise source that interacts with an adaptation
      current. At higher spike frequencies, more strongly peaked
      distributions and positive interspike-interval correlations appear, as
      expected from a canonical model of supra-threshold firing driven by
      temporally correlated (i.e. colored) noise. Simulations of a minimal
      conductance-based model of the auditory receptor neuron with
      stochastic ion channels exclude the delayed rectifier as a possible
      noise source. Our analysis suggests channel noise from an adaptation
      current and the receptor or sodium current as main sources for the
      colored and white noise, respectively. By comparing the
      interspike-interval statistics with generic models, we find strong
      evidence for two distinct noise sources.  Our approach does not
      involve any dendritic or somatic recordings that may harm the delicate
      workings of many sensory systems. It could be applied to various other
      types of neurons, in which channel noise dominates the fluctuations
      that shape the neuron's spike statistics.
