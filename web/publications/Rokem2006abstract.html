    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    Sensory systems must translate incoming signals quickly and
    reliably so that an animal can act successfully in its
    environment. Even at the level of receptor neurons, however,
    functional aspects of the sensory encoding process are not yet
    fully understood. Specifically, this concerns the question how
    stimulus features and neural response characteristics lead to an
    efficient transmission of sensory information. To address this
    issue, we have recorded and analyzed spike trains from grasshopper
    auditory receptors, while systematically varying the stimulus
    statistics. The stimulus variations profoundly influenced the
    efficiency of neural encoding. This influence was largely
    attributable to the presence of specific stimulus features that
    triggered remarkably precise spikes whose trial-to-trial timing
    variability was as low as 0.15 ms - one order of magnitude shorter
    than typical stimulus time scales. Precise spikes decreased the
    noise entropy of the spike trains, thereby increasing the rate of
    information transmission. In contrast, the total spike train
    entropy, which quantifies the variety of different spike train
    patterns, hardly changed when stimulus conditions were altered, as
    long as the neural firing rate remained the same. This finding
    shows that stimulus distributions that were transmitted with high
    information rates did not invoke additional response patterns, but
    instead displayed exceptional temporal precision in their neural
    representation. The acoustic stimuli that led to the highest
    information rates and smallest spike-time jitter feature
    pronounced sound-pressure deflections lasting for 2-3 ms. These
    upstrokes are reminiscent of salient structures found in natural
    grasshopper communication signals, suggesting that precise spikes
    selectively encode particularly important aspects of the natural
    stimulus environment.
