    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    Spike-frequency adaptation affects the response characteristics of
    many sensory neurons, and different biophysical processes
    contribute to this phenomenon. Many cellular mechanisms underlying
    adaptation are triggered by the spike output of the neuron in a
    feedback manner (e.g., specific potassium currents that are
    primarily activated by the spiking activity). In contrast, other
    components of adaptation may be caused by, in a feedforward way,
    the sensory or synaptic input, which the neuron receives. Examples
    include viscoelasticity of mechanoreceptors, transducer adaptation
    in hair cells, and short-term synaptic depression. For a
    functional characterization of spike-frequency adaptation, it is
    essential to understand the dependence of adaptation on the input
    and output of the neuron. Here, we demonstrate how an input-driven
    component of adaptation can be uncovered in vivo from recordings
    of spike trains in an insect auditory receptor neuron, even if the
    total adaptation is dominated by output-driven components. Our
    method is based on the identification of different inputs that
    yield the same output and sudden switches between these inputs. In
    particular, we determined for different sound frequencies those
    intensities that are required to yield a predefined steady-state
    firing rate of the neuron. We then found that switching between
    these sound frequencies causes transient deviations of the firing
    rate. These firing-rate deflections are evidence of input-driven
    adaptation and can be used to quantify how this adaptation
    component affects the neural activity. Based on previous knowledge
    of the processes in auditory transduction, we conclude that for
    the investigated auditory receptor neurons, this adaptation
    phenomenon is of mechanical origin.
