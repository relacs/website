    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    Every sensation begins with the conversion of a sensory stimulus
    into the response of a receptor neuron. Typically, this involves a
    sequence of multiple biophysical processes that cannot all be
    monitored directly. In this work, we present an approach that is
    based on analyzing different stimuli that cause the same final
    output, here defined as the probability of the receptor neuron to
    fire a single action potential. Comparing such iso-response
    stimuli within the framework of nonlinear cascade models allows us
    to extract the characteristics of individual signal-processing
    steps with a temporal resolution much finer than the
    trial-to-trial variability of the measured output spike
    times. Applied to insect auditory receptor cells, the technique
    reveals the sub-millisecond dynamics of the eardrum vibration and
    of the electrical potential and yields a quantitative four-step
    cascade model. The model accounts for the tuning properties of
    this class of neurons and explains their high temporal resolution
    under natural stimulation. Owing to its simplicity and generality,
    the presented method is readily applicable to other nonlinear
    cascades and a large variety of signal-processing systems.
