    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    The brown ghost knifefish, <i>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</i>, is a model
    wave-type gymnotiform used extensively in neuroethological
    studies. As all weakly electric fish, they produce an electric
    field (electric organ discharge, EOD) and can detect electric
    signals in their environments using electroreceptors. During
    social interactions, <i>A. leptorhynchus</i> produce communication
    signals by modulating the frequency and amplitude of their
    EOD. The Type 2 chirp, a transient increase in EOD frequency, is
    the most common modulation type. We will first present a
    description of <i>A. leptorhynchus</i> chirp production from a
    behavioural perspective, followed by a discussion of the
    mechanisms by which chirps are encoded by electroreceptor
    afferents (P-units). Both the production and encoding of chirps
    are influenced by the difference in EOD frequency between
    interacting fish, the so called beat, or difference frequency
    (Df). Chirps are produced most often when the Df is small, whereas
    attacks are more common when Dfs are large. Correlation analysis
    has shown that chirp production induces an echo response in
    interacting conspecifics and that chirps are produced when attack
    rates are low. Here we show that both of these relationships are
    strongest when Dfs are large. Electrophysiological recordings from
    electroreceptor afferents (P-units) have suggested that small,
    Type 2 chirps are encoded by increases in electroreceptor
    synchrony at low Dfs only. How Type 2 chirps are encoded at higher
    Dfs, where the signals seem to exert the greatest behavioural
    influence, was unknown. Here, we provide evidence that at higher
    Dfs, chirps could be encoded by a desynchronization of the P-unit
    population activity.
