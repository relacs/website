    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      To date, non-reproducibility of neurophysiological research is a
      matter of intense discussion in the scientific community. A
      crucial component to enhance reproducibility is to
      comprehensively collect and store metadata, that is, all
      information about the experiment, the data, and the applied
      preprocessing steps on the data, such that they can be accessed
      and shared in a consistent and simple manner. However, the
      complexity of experiments, the highly specialized analysis
      workflows and a lack of knowledge on how to make use of
      supporting software tools often overburden researchers to
      perform such a detailed documentation. For this reason, the
      collected metadata are often incomplete, incomprehensible for
      outsiders or ambiguous. Based on our research experience in
      dealing with diverse datasets, we here provide conceptual and
      technical guidance to overcome the challenges associated with
      the collection, organization, and storage of metadata in a
      neurophysiology laboratory. Through the concrete example of
      managing the metadata of a complex experiment that yields
      multi-channel recordings from monkeys performing a behavioral
      motor task, we practically demonstrate the implementation of
      these approaches and solutions with the intention that they may
      be generalized to other projects. Moreover, we detail five use
      cases that demonstrate the resulting benefits of constructing a
      well-organized metadata collection when processing or analyzing
      the recorded data, in particular when these are shared between
      laboratories in a modern scientific collaboration. Finally, we
      suggest an adaptable workflow to accumulate, structure and store
      metadata from different sources using, by way of example, the
      odML metadata framework.
