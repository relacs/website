    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    Despite their simple auditory systems, some insect species
    recognize certain temporal aspects of acoustic stimuli with an
    acuity equal to that of vertebrates; however, the underlying
    neural mechanisms and coding schemes are only partially
    understood. In this study, we analyze the response characteristics
    of the peripheral auditory system of grasshoppers with special
    emphasis on the representation of species-specific communication
    signals. We use both natural calling songs and artificial random
    stimuli designed to focus on two low-order statistical properties
    of the songs: their typical time scales and the distribution of
    their modulation amplitudes.

    Based on stimulus reconstruction techniques and quantified within
    an information-theoretic framework, our data show that artificial
    stimuli with typical time scales of >40 msec can be read from
    single spike trains with high accuracy. Faster stimulus variations
    can be reconstructed only for behaviorally relevant amplitude
    distributions. The highest rates of information transmission (180
    bits/sec) and the highest coding efficiencies (40%) are obtained
    for stimuli that capture both the time scales and amplitude
    distributions of natural songs.

    Use of multiple spike trains significantly improves the
    reconstruction of stimuli that vary on time scales <40 msec or
    feature amplitude distributions as occur when several grasshopper
    songs overlap. Signal-to-noise ratios obtained from the
    reconstructions of natural songs do not exceed those obtained from
    artificial stimuli with the same low-order statistical
    properties. We conclude that auditory receptor neurons are
    optimized to extract both the time scales and the amplitude
    distribution of natural songs. They are not optimized, however, to
    extract higher-order statistical properties of the song-specific
    rhythmic patterns.
