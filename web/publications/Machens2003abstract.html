    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    Animals that rely on acoustic communication to find mates, such as
    grasshoppers, are astonishingly accurate in recognizing song
    patterns that are specific to their own species. This raises
    the question of whether they can also solve a far more complicated
    task that might provide a basis for mate preference and sexual
    selection: to distinguish individual songs by detecting slight
    variations around the common species-specific theme. Using
    spike-train discriminability to quantify the precision of neural
    responses from the auditory periphery of a model grasshopper
    species, we show that information sufficient to distinguish songs
    is readily available at the single-cell level when the spike
    trains are analyzed on a millisecond time scale.
