    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    Shaped by evolutionary processes, sensory systems often represent
    behaviorally relevant stimuli with higher fidelity than other
    stimuli. The stimulus dependence of neural reliability could
    therefore provide an important clue in a search for relevant
    sensory signals. We explore this relation and introduce a novel
    iterative algorithm that allows one to find stimuli that are
    reliably represented by the sensory system under study. To assess
    the quality of a neural representation, we use stimulus
    reconstruction methods. The algorithm starts with the presentation
    of an initial stimulus (e.g. white noise). The evoked spike train
    is recorded and used to reconstruct the stimulus online. Within a
    closed-loop setup, this reconstruction is then played back to the
    sensory system. Iterating this procedure, the newly generated
    stimuli can be better and better reconstructed. We demonstrate the
    feasibility of this method by applying it to auditory receptor
    neurons in locusts. Our data show that the optimal stimuli often
    exhibit pronounced sub-threshold periods that are interrupted by
    short, yet intense pulses. Similar results are obtained for simple
    model neurons and suggest that these stimuli are encoded with high
    reliability by a large class of neurons.
