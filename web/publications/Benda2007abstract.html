    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    Sensory systems extract behaviorally relevant information from a
    continuous stream of complex high-dimensional input
    signals. Understanding the detailed dynamics and precise neural
    code, even of a single neuron, is therefore a non-trivial
    task. Automated closed-loop approaches that integrate data
    analysis in the experimental design ease the investigation of
    sensory systems in three directions: First, adaptive sampling
    speeds up the data acquisition and thus increases the yield of an
    experiment. Second, model-driven stimulus exploration improves the
    quality of experimental data needed to discriminate between
    alternative hypotheses. Third, information-theoretic data analyses
    open up novel ways to search for those stimuli that are most
    efficient in driving a given neuron in terms of its firing rate or
    coding quality. Examples from different sensory systems show that,
    in all three directions, substantial progress can be achieved once
    rapid online data analysis, adaptive sampling, and computational
    modeling are tightly integrated into experiments.
