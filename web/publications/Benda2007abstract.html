    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    Sensory systems extract behaviorally relevant information from a
    continuous stream of complex high-dimensional input
    signals. Understanding the detailed dynamics and precise neural
    code, even of a single neuron, is therefore a non-trivial
    task. Automated closed-loop approaches that integrate data
    analysis in the experimental design ease the investigation of
    sensory systems in three directions: First, adaptive sampling
    speeds up the data acquisition and thus increases the yield of an
    experiment. Second, model-driven stimulus exploration improves the
    quality of experimental data needed to discriminate between
    alternative hypotheses. Third, information-theoretic data analyses
    open up novel ways to search for those stimuli that are most
    efficient in driving a given neuron in terms of its firing rate or
    coding quality. Examples from different sensory systems show that,
    in all three directions, substantial progress can be achieved once
    rapid online data analysis, adaptive sampling, and computational
    modeling are tightly integrated into experiments.

	Adaptive estimation of receptive fields, as demonstrated by a
	numerical simulation study. (a) The top row shows how the
	structure of a receptive field builds up gradually when a
	standard neurophysiological approach is used. Here,
	white-noise stimuli are presented and the receptive field is
	estimated as the spike-triggered average. The bottom row shows
	results from an adaptive sampling technique in which each new
	stimulus is selected such that it maximizes the information
	gained about the receptive field. (b) The true receptive
	field. (c) The uncertainty of the estimates, quantified by the
	entropy of the parameter distribution, drops far more rapidly
	for the adaptive sampling technique than for white-noise
	sampling (data provided by courtesy of J. Lewi).

        Iterative search for optimal stimulus ensembles (OSEs). (a) In
        this analysis of an auditory receptor neuron, stimuli are sets
        of ten 80 ms-long snippets of white-noise amplitude
        modulations of a sine-wave carrier. Sample mean and standard
        deviation (colored dots in top-left panel) are drawn from a
        two-dimensional Gaussian distribution whose standard deviation
        is represented by the black ellipse. The stimuli are played
        repeatedly (top-right panel), resulting in spike-train
        responses that vary slightly from trial to trial (bottom-right
        panel). On the basis of the responses from several trials, the
        contribution of each stimulus to the mutual information is
        estimated; this contribution is depicted by the size of the
        colored dots representing the individual snippets (bottom-left
        panel). The contributions are taken as weight factors to
        update the parameters of the Gaussian distribution that is
        thus shifted toward the more important stimuli (new black
        ellipse). The updated stimulus ensemble is then used to draw
        new, additional test stimuli. (b) For a longer sample run with
        multiple iterations, intermediate estimates of the OSE (grey)
        rapidly converge to the final OSE (black). As shown by the
        iso-firing-rate lines, the OSE is centered at the steepest
        part of the tuning curve and triggers responses that cover
        almost the full range of firing rates. As desired, the OSE is
        thus indeed located in the most informative region in stimulus
        space. (c) Accordingly, the information rate initially grows
        rather fast with each iteration until it saturates after about
        20 iterations.

        Discrimination of alternative response relations using the
        Iso-Response Method. (a and b) A hypothetical two-dimensional
        stimulus space is spanned by the variables s1 and s2. The
        drawn surfaces represent the response r(s1,s2) for two
        different models, which take the linear (a) and quadratic sum
        (b) as the argument of a sigmoid non-linearity. Although the
        two input-output scenarios are fundamentally
        different, both produce exactly the same one-dimensional
        response functions r(s1) and r(s2), respectively, as seen by
        the black areas at the sides of the surface blocks.
        Furthermore, any measurement along a radial direction, as is
        common in physiological experiments, will produce similar
        sigmoid response curves in both cases, as seen by the thick
        black lines running along the surfaces. The iso-response
        manifolds r=const (here: one-dimensional curves) below the
        surface plots, however, give a clear signature of the
        different underlying processes. (c) Iso-firing-rate curves for
        an auditory neuron stimulated by superpositions of two pure
        tones. The measured pairs of amplitudes s1 and s2
        corresponding to a firing rate r of 150 Hz are shown together
        with the iso-firing-rate curves for the two scenarios which
        now correspond to sound-amplitude integration (a) and
        sound-energy integration (b), respectively. The straight line
        for the amplitude hypothesis deviates systematically from the
        data, whereas the ellipse obtained from the energy hypothesis
        provides an excellent fit. The different scales on the axes
        reflect the strong frequency dependence of the neuron's sound
        sensitivity. (d) As expected from the sound-energy model,
        iso-response lines for different output firing rates are
        scaled ellipses.
