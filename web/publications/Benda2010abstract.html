    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>
      Spike-frequency adaptation is a prominent aspect of neuronal
      dynamics that shapes a neuron's signal processing properties
      on timescales ranging from about 10&nbsp;ms to more than 1&nbsp;s.  For
      integrate-and-fire model neurons spike-frequency adaptation is
      incorporated either as an adaptation current or as a dynamic
      firing threshold. Whether a physiologically observed adaptation
      mechanism should be modeled as an adaptation current or a
      dynamic threshold is, however, not known. Here we show that a
      dynamic threshold has a divisive effect on the onset f-I&nbsp;curve
      (the initial maximal firing rate following a step increase in an
      input current) measured at increasing mean threshold levels,
      i.e. adaptation states. In contrast, an adaptation current
      subtractively shifts this f-I&nbsp;curve to higher inputs without
      affecting its slope. As a consequence, an adaptation current
      acts essentially linearly, resulting in a high-pass filter
      component of the neuron's transfer function for current
      stimuli. With a dynamic threshold, however, the transfer
      function strongly depends on the input range, because of the
      multiplicative effect on the f-I&nbsp;curves. Simulations of
      conductance-based spiking models with adaptation currents, such
      as AHP-type, M-type, and sodium activated potassium currents, do
      not show the divisive effects of a dynamic threshold, but agree
      with the properties of integrate-and-fire neurons with
      adaptation current. Notably, the effects of slow inactivation
      of sodium currents cannot be reproduced by either model. Our
      results suggests that, when lateral shifts of the onset f-I
      curve are seen in response to adapting inputs, adaptation should
      be modeled with adaptation currents and not with a dynamic
      threshold. In contrast, when the slope of onset f-I&nbsp;curves
      depends on the adaptation state, then adaptation should be
      modeled with a dynamic threshold. Further, the observation of
      divisively altered onset f-I&nbsp;curves in adapted neurons with
      notable variability of their spike threshold could hint to yet
      unknown biophysical mechanisms directly affecting the threshold.
