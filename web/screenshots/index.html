    <strong>The Relacs GUI.</strong>
    You see the four main widgets of <span class="relacs">relacs</span>:
    <dl>
      <dt>Voltage traces</dt>
      <dd>
        (top right) The plot shows the currently recorded voltage trace
        (green) together with optionally filtered traces (no ones in this example)
        and detected events, such as spikes (yellow circels).
      </dd>

      <dt>Filter/Detectors</dt>
      <dd>
        (top left) Here you can set parameter of filter and detectors
        that are immediately applied on the recorded data.
	The example shows a <a href="../plugins/ephys/EPhys-SpikeDetector.html">spike detector</a>
        that displays the distribution of peaks in the voltage trace
        that were detected as spikes (green) and non-detected peaks (red).
        The vertical white line inbetween is the current threshold 
	used for detecting peaks as spikes.
      </dd>

      <dt>Controls</dt>
      <dd>
        (bottom left) Various widgets can display the current state of
        the recording or some general features such as the power
        spectrum of the recorded voltage trace.  In the example you
        see the threshold curve of an auditory neuron (upper plot,
        stimulus required to evoke a minimal response as a function of
        sound frequency) and the f-I curve at the carrier frequency
        where the neuron is most sensitive (lower plot, firing rate
        versus stimulus intensity).
      </dd>

      <dt>Research protocols</dt>
      <dd>
        (bottom right) The research protocols run the experiment.
        That is, they generate and play stimuli, analyse the recordings,
	save data, and display important results.
        Here, an Ohrnbeck-Uhlenstein noise (lower plot, green trace)
        is used to stimulate an auditory receptor neuron.
        The resulting spike raster (red strokes) and the firing rates
        (yellow and orange lines) are displayed in the upper plot.
      </dd>

    <strong>The Relacs Tux.</strong> The Linux-kernel mascot very
    relaxed holds a micro-electrode for electrophysiological
    recordings. The mexican hat symbolizes a neuron's receptive field
    that is better to be recorded in a closed-loop fashion.
