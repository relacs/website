  We are using this program very succesfully in our lab
  (see <a href="../publications/index.html">list of publications</a>), but before
  we publish a first official release we need to finish a few things,
  that - however - make a lot of work.
  See <a href="#roadmap">roadmap</a> below.
</p>
<p>
  We hope to have most of all this ready soon (well, in spring 2009 - we are closer than ever).
  If you want to be notified about the first release,
  write me an email: benda@bio.lmu.de, subject: RELACS.
</p>
<p>
  If you can't wait for the official release, you can
  download a snapshot fom the subversion repository
  (<a href="#svn">see below for instructions</a>).

<h3>Subversion</h3>
<p>
  You can retrieve a snapshot of the current development version
  from the
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=199846">Subversion repository</a> on
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/relacs">

<p>
  Use the following command to retrieve the current source tree:
</p>
<pre>
svn co https://relacs.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/relacs/relacs/trunk relacs</pre>
<p>
  (this command will download the source files into the directory <tt>./relacs></tt>).
</p>
<p>
  Then change to the <tt>relacs</tt> directory and
  read the <a href="../doc/readme.html">README</a> and the 
  <a href="../doc/install.html">INSTALL</a> files for more instructions.

  After downloading, unpack the relacs.tgz file and change into the
  relacs directory:
</p>
<pre>
> tar xzvf relacs-xxx.tgz
> cd relacs-xxx</pre>
<p>
  Then read the <a href="../doc/readme.html">README</a> and the

<a name="platforms"></a>
<h3>Supported Platforms</h3>
<p> <span class="relacs">relacs</span> is currently developed under Linux. 
  However, since it is coded in
  standard C++ and uses the Qt-library for the GUI,
  a port to Mac OS X and Windows should be possible.
  For this, it would be helpful to change to Qt version 4 first.
  Also, interfaces to the (data acquisition)
  devices need to be implemented for each platform as needed.
  Any help is appreciated!
</p>


<a name="requirements"></a>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Linux with kernel version 2.6</li>
  <li>GNU autotools</li>
  <li><a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/">Qt version 3.3</a> (older versions have a bug in the thread support).</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">Gnu Scientific Library</a> (recommended)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">doxygen</a> for generating the documentation</li>
</ul>

<a name="roadmap"></a>
<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Phase 1 - Basic development</dt>
  <dd>
    We have been continually developing and using
    <span class="relacs">relacs</span> in our lab since 2000.
    Features are added as we need them.
    This development was and still is driven by the very specific requirements
    of our experiments (see <a href="../publications">publications</a>).
  </dd>

  <dt>Phase 2 - Modularization and generalization</dt>
  <dd>
    Soon we realized that the structure of the program was way to
    specialized and we started to better modularize the code
    and to outsource everything that was specific to our experiments
    as a plugin. As a result the core program is now completely 
    independent of the specific hardware used and independent of
    the type of experimental setup.
  </dd>

  <dt>Phase 3 - Technical issues (version 0.9.6)</dt>
  <dd>
    Since 2007 we are actively making the program ready to be shared
    with other people, i.e. setting up GNU autotools and finalizing 
    the interfaces.
    Since most of this is accomplished by now
    you are welcome to join the project and contribute to it.
  </dd>

  <dt>Phase 4 - New urgent features (version 0.9.7)</dt>
  <dd>
    A couple of new features need to be implemented or finished as
    soon as possible (most of this by spring-summer 2009):
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamic clamp support</li>
      <li>Data browser</li>
      <li>Plugins for current and voltage clamp recordings</li>
      <li>Update the plugins for the electric fish experiments</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>Phase 5 - Usability (version 1.0)</dt>
  <dd>
    A program that is highly modular and that compiles and runs
    flawlessly is still hard to use if the documentation is incomplete
    and configuration files are not explained.
    Therefore, the following things need to be accomplished
    before <span class="relacs">relacs</span> is really
    usable:
    <ol>
      <li>Add a tutorial to the documentation</li>
      <li>Add various widgets and wizards 
          for configuring <span class="relacs">relacs</span>:
        <ul>
          <li>Macro editor</li>
          <li>Filter and detector setup tool</li>
          <li>Data acquisition device and channel selection</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </dd>
