  </a>, from where you can download a source-code tarball.
</p>
<p>
  For getting the current development version you can
  download a snapshot from the subversion repository
  (<a href="#svn">see below for instructions</a>).
</p>


<a name="installation"></a>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
  After downloading the source-code tarball, 
  unpack the relacs-xxx.tgz file and change into the
  relacs directory:
</p>
<pre>
> tar xzvf relacs-xxx.tgz
> cd relacs-xxx</pre>
<p>
  Then read the <a href="../doc/readme.html">README</a> and the 
  <a href="../doc/install.html">INSTALL</a> files for more instructions.
</p>


<a name="svn"></a>
<h3>Subversion</h3>
<p>
  You can retrieve a snapshot of the current development version
  from the
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/relacs/code/HEAD/tree">Subversion repository</a> on
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/relacs">
    <img src="http://sflogo.sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=199846&type=10" width="80" height="15" border="0" align="top" alt="Get Relacs at SourceForge.net. Fast, secure and Free Open Source software downloads" />
  </a>.
</p>
<p>
  Make sure you have \c subversion installed on your computer:
</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install subversion</pre>
<p>
  Use the following command to retrieve the source tree of the current development version:
</p>
<pre>
  svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/relacs/code/relacs/trunk relacs</pre>
<p>
  This downloads the source files into the directory <tt>./relacs</tt>.
  In most cases, the current version should work and is the preferred version to work with.
  However, once in a while it is broken.
  Be warned! You might then give it another try a couple of days later.
</p>
<p>
  Continue with the instructions given in the 
  <a href="../doc/install.html">INSTALL</a> file. You may also want to
  read the <a href="../doc/readme.html">README</a> file.
</p>
<p>
  You can also
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/relacs/code/HEAD/tree/relacs/trunk">browse</a>
  the Subversion repository.

<a name="platforms"></a>
<h3>Supported Platforms</h3>
<p> <span class="relacs">relacs</span> is currently developed under Linux. 
  However, since it is coded in
  standard C++ and uses the Qt-library for the GUI,
  a port to Mac OS X and Windows should be possible.
  However, interfaces to the (data acquisition)
  devices need to be implemented for each platform as needed.
  Any help is appreciated!
</p>

<a name="roadmap"></a>
<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Phase 1 - Basic development</dt>
  <dd>
    We have been continually developing and using
    <span class="relacs">relacs</span> in our lab since 2000.
    Features are added as we need them.
    This development was and still is driven by the very specific requirements
    of our experiments (see <a href="../publications">publications</a>).
  </dd>

  <dt>Phase 2 - Modularization and generalization</dt>
  <dd>
    Soon we realized that the structure of the program was way to
    specialized and we started to better modularize the code
    and to outsource everything that was specific to our experiments
    as a plugin. As a result the core program is now completely 
    independent of the specific hardware used and independent of
    the type of experimental setup.
  </dd>

  <dt>Phase 3 - Technical issues (version 0.9.6)</dt>
  <dd>
    Since 2007 we are actively making the program ready to be shared
    with other people, i.e. setting up GNU autotools and finalizing 
    the interfaces.
    Most of this is accomplished by now and
    you are welcome to join the project and contribute to it.
  </dd>

  <dt>Phase 4A - New urgent features I (version 0.9.7, the current stable version)</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamic clamp support</li>
      <li>Upgrade to Qt4</li>
      <li>Plugins for current clamp recordings</li>
      <li>Update the plugins for the electric fish experiments</li>
    </ul>
    Have been implemented and run very well in the experiments.
  </dd>

  <dt>Phase 4B - New urgent features II (version 0.9.8, the current development version)</dt>
  <dd>
    In this version we currently reimplement all name-value pair representations
    (configuration files, dialogs, table keys, stimulus descriptions, etc., i.e. class Options)
    to be
    <ul>
      <li>hierarchical name-value pairs that
      follow <a href="http://www.g-node.de/odml/">odML</a>
      standard.</li>
    </ul>
    Once this is done, we finish the long awaited
    <ul>
      <li>data browser.</li>
    </ul>
    In addition we need to improve
    <ul>
      <li>file formats for the data.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>Phase 5 - Usability (version 1.0, the future)</dt>
  <dd>
    A program that is highly modular and that compiles and runs
    flawlessly is still hard to use if the documentation is incomplete
    and configuration files are not explained.
    Therefore, the following things need to be accomplished
    before <span class="relacs">relacs</span> is really
    usable:
    <ol>
      <li>Add a tutorial to the documentation</li>
      <li>Add various widgets and wizards 
          for configuring <span class="relacs">relacs</span>:
        <ul>
          <li>Macro editor</li>
          <li>Filter and detector setup tool</li>
          <li>Data acquisition device and channel selection (work in progress)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </dd>
