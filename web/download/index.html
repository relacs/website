<h3>Installation from git repository</h3>
<p>
  We recommend to clone the <span class="relacs">relacs</span> sources
  from the <a href="https://github.com/relacs/relacs">
    <img src="github.png" height="15" border="0" align="top" /></a> 
  development repository.
</p>
<p>
  Make sure you have <tt>git</tt> installed on your computer:
</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install git</pre>
<p>
  Use the following command to retrieve the source tree of the current
  development version:
</p>
<pre>
  git clone https://github.com/relacs/relacs.git relacs</pre>
<p>
  This downloads the source files into the directory <tt>./relacs</tt>.
  In most cases, the current version should work and is the preferred
  version to work with.
  However, once in a while it is broken.
  Be warned! You might then give it another try a couple of days later.
</p>
<p>
  Continue with the instructions given in the 
  <a href="../doc/install.html">INSTALL</a> file. You may also want to
  read the <a href="../doc/readme.html">README</a> file.
</p>
<p>
  You can also
  <a href="https://github.com/relacs/relacs">browse</a>
  the git repository directly at <a href="https://github.com/relacs/relacs">
    <img src="github.png" height="15" border="0" align="top" /></a>.

<a name="subversion"></a>
<h3>Installation from release tar-ball</h3>
<p>
  Download the source-code tarball from
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/relacs">
    <img src="http://sflogo.sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=199846&type=10" width="80" height="15" border="0" align="top" alt="Get Relacs at SourceForge.net. Fast, secure and Free Open Source software downloads" /></a>, 
  unpack the relacs-xxx.tgz file and change into the
  relacs directory:
</p>
<pre>
> tar xzvf relacs-xxx.tgz
> cd relacs-xxx</pre>
<p>
  Then read the <a href="../doc/readme.html">README</a> and the 
  <a href="../doc/install.html">INSTALL</a> files for more instructions.
</p>
<p>
  Note, that the releases are often quite outdated...

<a name="platforms"></a>
<h3>Supported Platforms</h3>
<p> <span class="relacs">relacs</span> is currently developed under Linux. 
  However, since it is coded in
  standard C++ and uses the Qt-library for the GUI,
  a port to Mac OS X and Windows should be possible.
  However, interfaces to the (data acquisition)
  devices need to be implemented for each platform as needed.
  Any help is appreciated!

<a name="roadmap"></a>
<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Phase 1 - Basic development</dt>
  <dd>
    We have been continually developing and using
    <span class="relacs">relacs</span> in our lab since 2000.
    Features are added as we need them.
    This development was and still is driven by the very specific requirements
    of our experiments (see <a href="../publications">publications</a>).
  </dd>

  <dt>Phase 2 - Modularization and generalization</dt>
  <dd>
    Soon we realized that the structure of the program was way to
    specialized and we started to better modularize the code
    and to outsource everything that was specific to our experiments
    as a plugin. As a result the core program is now completely 
    independent of the specific hardware used and independent of
    the type of experimental setup.
  </dd>

  <dt>Phase 3 - Technical issues (version 0.9.6)</dt>
  <dd>
    In 2007 we started to make the program ready to be shared with
    other people, i.e. setting up GNU autotools and finalizing the
    interfaces. This is accomplished and you are welcome to join the
    project and contribute to it.
  </dd>

  <dt>Phase 4A - New urgent features I (version 0.9.7)</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamic clamp support</li>
      <li>Upgrade to Qt4</li>
      <li>Plugins for current clamp recordings</li>
      <li>Update the plugins for the electric fish experiments</li>
    </ul>
    Have been implemented and run very well in the experiments.
  </dd>

  <dt>Phase 4B - New urgent features II (version 0.9.8, the current development version)</dt>
  <dd>
    In this version we reimplemented all name-value pair representations
    (configuration files, dialogs, table keys, stimulus descriptions, etc., i.e. class Options)
    to be
    <ul>
      <li>hierarchical name-value pairs that
      follow <a href="http://www.g-node.de/odml/">odML</a>
      standard.</li>
    </ul>
    We still need to finish the long awaited
    <ul>
      <li>data browser.</li>
    </ul>
    In addition we started to implement
    <ul>
      <li>the <a href="https://github.com/G-Node/nix">NIX</a> file
      format for storing the data together with meta-data.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>Phase 5 - Usability (version 1.0, the future)</dt>
  <dd>
    A program that is highly modular and that compiles and runs
    flawlessly is still hard to use if the documentation is incomplete
    and configuration files are not explained.
    Therefore, the following things need to be accomplished
    before <span class="relacs">relacs</span> is easily
    usable:
    <ol>
      <li>Add a tutorial to the documentation</li>
      <li>Add various widgets and wizards 
          for configuring <span class="relacs">relacs</span>:
        <ul>
          <li>Macro editor</li>
          <li>Filter and detector setup tool</li>
          <li>Data acquisition device and channel selection</li>
        </ul>
	This is work in progress.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </dd>
