<h2>Features</h2>


<p>
  The <span class="relacs">relacs</span> software platform offers the 
  following main features:
</p>


<a name="closedloop"></a>
<h3>Closed-loop experiments</h3>
<p>
  Traditionally, appropriate stimuli for probing a neuron
  are generated first.
  Then some days are spent doing experiments with the new stimuli.
  Afterwards the preliminary data are analyzed offline.
  Based on the findings the experimental protocol and the stimuli
  are modified and new experiments are conducted.

<p>
  <span class="relacs">relacs</span> is designed as an framework for
  closed-loop experiments that may considerably speed up
  this traditional approach and
  in addition offers novel experimental possibilities.
  In a closed-loop experiment a stimulus is presented (1),
  the resulting response (2) is analyzed immediately (3),
  and properties of the next stimulus (4) (mean intensity,
  standard deviation, spectral content...)
  are adjusted as needed (see figure).
</p>

<p>
  The closed-loop approach is beneficial on many levels,
  even for traditional experimental paradigms:
</p>
<ul>

  <li>Processed results are displayed immediately in addition
  to the raw voltage traces and thus give the experimenter valuable
  quantitative information about the recorded cell during a running 
  experiment. For example, quality of the spike detection,
  sensitivity or input resistance of the cell, heart rate, etc.</li>

  <li>Probing the neuron with stimuli that are outside its dynamic range
  can be avoided and thus the yield of a recording is maximized.</li>

  <li>Advancing of individual electrodes can be automated,
  such that the chance to get a dual recording
  is increased.</li>

</ul>

<p>
  Closed-loop experiments, however, also offer new experimental designs:
</p>
<ul>

  <li>Optimal search for a neuron's receptive field.
      <a href="../publications/Benda2007abstract.html#receptivefield">More ...</a></li>

  <li>Search for stimuli that drive a neuron in an "optimal"
      way (firing rate, coding quality, mutual information).
      <a href="../publications/Benda2007abstract.html#optimalstimulus">More ...</a></li>

  <li>Find set's of stimulus parameter that result in the
      same response (iso-response method).
      <a href="../publications/Benda2007abstract.html#isoresponse">More ...</a></li>

</ul>

  for more details.
</p>


<a name="hardware"></a>
<h3>Hardware-independent research protocols</h3>
<p>
  Central to <span class="relacs">relacs</span> are the "research
  protocols" (RePros). They control the experiment by analysing and
  visualizing data and generating stimuli. The 
  <span class="relacs">relacs</span>-core
  completely hides all specific hardware details behind the scenes.
  Therefore research protocols can be implemented independently of
  the hardware used at a particular experimental setup (data
  acquisition board, attenuator, temperature sensors, motorized
  micromanipulators).  This allows to use the very same research
  protocols for all your different experimental setups in your lab, no
  matter what particular hardware is used.  Furthermore, this offers
  the unique possibility to share research protocols with other
  labs.
</p>


<a name="analysis"></a>
<h3>Data-analysis library</h3>
<p>
  <span class="relacs">relacs</span> comes with an extensive set of data-analysis functions.
  The functions are implemented in C++ to allow fast and memory efficient
  data-analysis as it is required for closed-loop experiments.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic statistics
      (mean, standard deviation, median, correlation ...)</li>
  <li>Spectral analysis: power spectrum, transfer function, coherence</li>
  <li>Linear and nonlinear fits (Levenberg-Marquardt and Simplex)</li>
  <li>Peak detection</li>
  <li>Histograms, interpolation</li>
  <li>Stimulus generation: pulse, saw tooth,
      band-pass filtered white noise, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise</li>
  <li>Firing rates: mean, binned, convolved with kernels
      (rectangle, triangle, gaussian, exponential, ...), 1/ISI</li>
  <li>Interspike intervals: histogram, CV, serial correlation</li>
  <li>Spike timing precision: vector strength, reliability,
      correlation, synchrony</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>
  New functions are added as required.
</p>


<a name="metadata"></a>
<h3>Meta-data</h3>
<p>
  Very important for enhancing the reusability of acquired data
  is their annotation with all sorts of meta-data that
  specify the context and the details of the experiment.
  Upon completion of a recording, <span class="relacs">relacs</span> immediately forces the
  experimenter to provide this important information
  through a freely configurable dialog.
  In addition, for each recording all configuration files, log files, and
  settings of the research protocols are saved as well.
</p>
<p>
  We are currently working on developing a standard for sharing meta
  data of electrophysiological experiments (supported by <a
  href="http://www.g-node.de/">G-Node</a>).  Specifically, in
  collaboration with the <a
  href="http://lablog.sourceforge.net">LabLog</a> project we work on a
  solution for directly storing the meta-data acquired by <span
  class="relacs">relacs</span> into a data-base .

<a name="dynclamp"></a>
<h3>Dynamic clamp</h3>

  <div class="caption" style="max-width:400px">
    The dynamic clamp. During each sampling cycle a voltage V is read in,
    a current I is computed, and this current is injected back into the cell.
  </div>
  <div class="bottom"></div>
</div>

<p>
  The dynamic clamp is a technique that is used in the neurosciences
  to artificially introduce ionic conductances to a neuron.
  This is accomplished by a closed-loop system running on a per-sample basis.
  First, a voltage value is read in.
  Then, a current is computed depending on that voltage.
  Finally, this current is injected back into the cell.
</p>

<p>
  Dynamic clamp can be easily added to <span class="relacs">relacs</span>
  by providing a specific implementation of the AnanlogInput and AnalogOutput
  device classes.

  Currently, an implementation based on <a
  href="http://www.rtai.org">RTAI</a> real-time Linux and <a
  href="http://www.comedi.org">comedi</a> for accessing data
  acquisition boards is provided (<a href="../plugins/comedi/Comedi-DynClampAnalogInput.html">DynClampAnalogInput</a>
  and <a href="../plugins/comedi/Comedi-DynClampAnalogOutput.html">DynClampAnalogOutput</a>).
</p>


<a name="model"></a>
<h3>Integration of experiment and model simulations</h3>
<p>
  Besides acquiring data from a real experiment,
  <span class="relacs">relacs</span> can also run in a simulation mode,
  where the data are acquired from a model simulation.
  This is a very important feature, that sets <span class="relacs">relacs</span> apart
  from many other data acquisition software:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>For developing advanced and optimized closed-loop
  research protocols, the simulation mode is essential to properly
  develop and test them in advance before they are applied
  to an experiment.</li>

  <li>The simulation mode allows to test both, the real neuron
  and a model, with exactly the same research protocols.
  This is advantageous for model development close to
  experimental data.</li>

</ol>
<p>
  Models can be implemented as a <a href="../plugins/models.html">Model plugin</a>
  for <span class="relacs">relacs</span>.
