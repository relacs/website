    <h2>Features</h2>


    <p>
      The <span class="relacs">relacs</span> software platform offers the 
      following main features:
    </p>


    <a name="closedloop"></a>
    <h3>Closed-loop experiments</h3>
    <p>
      Traditionally, appropriate stimuli for probing a neuron
      are generated first.
      Then some days are spent doing experiments with the new stimuli.
      Afterwards the preliminary data are analyzed offline.
      Based on the findings the experimental protocol and the stimuli
      are modified and new experiments are conducted.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="relacs">relacs</span> is designed as an framework for
      closed-loop experiments that may considerably speed up
      this traditional approach and
      in addition offers novel experimental possibilities.
      In an closed-loop experiment a stimulus is presented (1),
      the resulting response (2) is analyzed immediately (3),
      and properties of the next stimulus (4) (mean intensity,
      standard deviation, spectral content...)
      are adjusted as needed (see figure).
    </p>

        Closed-loop experiments and adaptive sampling. First, the
        sensory system under investigation is presented with an
        initial stimulus such as a sound wave or a color
        image. Second, the neural system converts this input stimulus
        into an output response--the membrane potential of a single
        neuron, a multi-unit signal as measured in an extracellular
        recording, a calcium or EEG signal and so on. Third, this
        response is measured and recorded with a computer system. If
        necessary, spikes are automatically detected and sorted
        online. Following this data pre-processing, the neural
        response is further analyzed according to the theoretical
        framework underlying the specific experiment. Fourth, a new
        stimulus is generated on the basis of the results of this
        analysis thus closing the loop. Iterating this loop, stimuli
        can be generated that reflect the particular response
        characteristics of the studied system.  From <a

    <p>
      The closed-loop approach is beneficial on many levels,
      even for traditional experimental paradigms:
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li>Processed results are displayed immediately in addition
      to the raw voltage traces and thus give the experimenter valuable
      quantitative information about the recorded cell during a running 
      experiment. For example, quality of the spike detection,
      sensitivity or input resistance of the cell, heart rate, etc.</li>

      <li>Probing the neuron with stimuli that are outside its dynamic range
      can be avoided and thus the yield of a recording is maximized.</li>

      <li>Advancing of individuall electrodes can be automated,
      such that the chance to get a dual recording
      is increased.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      Closed-loop experiments, however, also offer new experimental designs:
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li>Optimal search for a neuron's receptive field.</li>

        Iterative search for optimal stimulus ensembles (OSEs). (a) In
        this analysis of an auditory receptor neuron, stimuli are sets
        of ten 80 ms-long snippets of white-noise amplitude
        modulations of a sine-wave carrier. Sample mean and standard
        deviation (colored dots in top-left panel) are drawn from a
        two-dimensional Gaussian distribution whose standard deviation
        is represented by the black ellipse. The stimuli are played
        repeatedly (top-right panel), resulting in spike-train
        responses that vary slightly from trial to trial (bottom-right
        panel). On the basis of the responses from several trials, the
        contribution of each stimulus to the mutual information is
        estimated; this contribution is depicted by the size of the
        colored dots representing the individual snippets (bottom-left
        panel). The contributions are taken as weight factors to
        update the parameters of the Gaussian distribution that is
        thus shifted toward the more important stimuli (new black
        ellipse). The updated stimulus ensemble is then used to draw
        new, additional test stimuli. (b) For a longer sample run with
        multiple iterations, intermediate estimates of the OSE (grey)
        rapidly converge to the final OSE (black). As shown by the
        iso-firing-rate lines, the OSE is centered at the steepest
        part of the tuning curve and triggers responses that cover
        almost the full range of firing rates. As desired, the OSE is
        thus indeed located in the most informative region in stimulus
        space. (c) Accordingly, the information rate initially grows
        rather fast with each iteration until it saturates after about
        20 iterations.

        Discrimination of alternative response relations using the
        Iso-Response Method. (a and b) A hypothetical two-dimensional
        stimulus space is spanned by the variables s1 and s2. The
        drawn surfaces represent the response r(s1,s2) for two
        different models, which take the linear (a) and quadratic sum
        (b) as the argument of a sigmoid non-linearity. Although the
        two input-output scenarios are fundamentally
        different, both produce exactly the same one-dimensional
        response functions r(s1) and r(s2), respectively, as seen by
        the black areas at the sides of the surface blocks.
        Furthermore, any measurement along a radial direction, as is
        common in physiological experiments, will produce similar
        sigmoid response curves in both cases, as seen by the thick
        black lines running along the surfaces. The iso-response
        manifolds r=const (here: one-dimensional curves) below the
        surface plots, however, give a clear signature of the
        different underlying processes. (c) Iso-firing-rate curves for
        an auditory neuron stimulated by superpositions of two pure
        tones. The measured pairs of amplitudes s1 and s2
        corresponding to a firing rate r of 150 Hz are shown together
        with the iso-firing-rate curves for the two scenarios which
        now correspond to sound-amplitude integration (a) and
        sound-energy integration (b), respectively. The straight line
        for the amplitude hypothesis deviates systematically from the
        data, whereas the ellipse obtained from the energy hypothesis
        provides an excellent fit. The different scales on the axes
        reflect the strong frequency dependence of the neuron's sound
        sensitivity. (d) As expected from the sound-energy model,
        iso-response lines for different output firing rates are
        scaled ellipses.

    <a name="model"></a>
    <h3>Integration of experiment and model simulations</h3>
    <p>
      Besides acquiring data from a real experiment,
      <span class="relacs">relacs</span> can also run in a simulation mode,
      where the data are acquired from a model simulation.
      This is a very important feature, that sets <span class="relacs">relacs</span> apart
      from many other data acquisition softwares:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>For developing advanced and optimized closed-loop
      experimental protocols, the simulation mode is essential to properly
      develop and test them in advance before they are applied
      to an experiment.</li>

      <li>The simulation mode allows to test both, the real neuron
      and a model, with exactly the same experimental protocols.
      This is advantageous for model development close to
      experimental data.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>
      Models can be implemented as a Model <a href="plugins">plugin</a>
      for <span class="relacs">relacs</span>.
    </p>


    <a name="hardware"></a>
    <h3>Hardware-independent experimental protocols</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="relacs">relacs</span> completely hides all specific hardware details behind the scenes.
      Therefore experimental protocols can be implemented
      independently of the hardware used at a particular experimental setup
      (data acquisition board, attenuator, temperature sensors, 
      motorized micromanipulators).
      This allows to use the very same experimental protocols for all your
      different experimental setups in your lab, no matter what particular 
      hardware is used.
      Furthermore, this offers the unique possibility to share
      experimental protocols with other labs.
    </p>


    <a name="threads"></a>
    <h3>Multi-threaded design</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="relacs">relacs</span> is fully multi-threaded, 
      i.e. many different tasks run in parallel
      (the acquisition of the data, spike detection, data analysis
      and stimulus generation, GUI interaction). This way,
      <span class="relacs">relacs</span> makes use of the computing power of 
      multi-processor machines 
      and therefore pushes the applicability of closed-loop algorithms to much
      larger data volumes, 
      as they are acquired from multi-unit recordings, for example.
    </p>


    <a name="analysis"></a>
    <h3>Data-analysis library</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="relacs">relacs</span> comes with an extensive set of data-analysis functions.
      The functions are implemented in C++ to allow fast and memory efficient
      data-analysis as it is required for closed-loop experiments.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic statistics
          (mean, standard deviation, median, correlation ...)</li>
      <li>Spectral analysis: power spectrum, transfer function, coherence</li>
      <li>Linear and nonlinear fits (Levenberg-Marquardt and Simplex)</li>
      <li>Peak detection</li>
      <li>Histograms, interpolation</li>
      <li>Stimulus generation: pulse, saw tooth,
	  band-pass filtered white noise, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise</li>
      <li>Firing rates: mean, binned, convolved with kernels
          (rectangle, triangle, gaussian, exponential, ...), 1/ISI</li>
      <li>Interspike intervals: histogram, CV, serial correlation</li>
      <li>Spike timing precision: vector strength, reliability,
          correlation, synchrony</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      New functions are added as required.
    </p>


    <a name="metadata"></a>
    <h3>Meta-data</h3>
    <p>
      Very important for enhancing the reusability of acquired data
      is their annotation with all sorts of meta-data that
      specify the context of the experiment.
      Upon completion of a recording, <span class="relacs">relacs</span> immediately forces the
      experimenter to provide this important information
      through a freely configurable dialog.
      In addition, for each recording all configuration files, log files, and
      version numbers and settings of the experimental protocols are saved
      as well.
    </p>


    <a name="free"></a>
    <h3>Free software</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="relacs">relacs</span> is distributed as 
      <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html">free software</a>
      ("free" as in "free speech")
      under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Everybody can use the program without the hassle of licenses of commercial software.</li>
      <li>Everybody can modify the program, i.e. add whatever new feature you need
          directly to the program.</li>
      <li>You can easily share the program and your specific experimental protocols
	  with your collaborators.</li>
      <li>You always have the possibility to look into source code,
	  so that you know what the program is really doing.
	  This is especially important when it comes to data analysis functions
	  where the science comes in.</li>
